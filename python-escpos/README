======

Python library to manipulate ESC/POS Printers.

------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Description

Python ESC/POS is a library which lets the user have access to all
those printers handled by ESC/POS commands, as defined by Epson,
from a Python application.

The standard usage is send raw text to the printer, but in also 
helps the user to enhance the experience with those printers by
facilitating the bar code printing in many different standards,
as well as manipulating images so they can be printed as brand
logo or any other usage images migh have. 

Text can be aligned/justified and fonts can be changed by size,
type and weight.

Also, this module handles some hardware functionalities like, cut
paper, carrier return, printer reset and others concerned to the
carriage alignment.

3. Donations

There are some different prints I'd like to acquire, but unfortunately
not all, even used, are cheaper and easy to get.

If you want to help funding money to get more printers or just want to
donate because you like the project, please be in touch and I'll be
sending my PayPal info so you can donate.

Thank you!
