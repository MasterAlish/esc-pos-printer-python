Example Python code for ESC POS Printers

I've found my old code for receipt printers. There are examples for USB and TCP/IP printers. 

### In examples you can find How to:

* Initialize printer
* Print cyrillic
* Cut paper
* Print QR (needs Pillow and qrcode libs)
* Print barcode
* Align text

### USB Receipt Printer

For using USB printer you need to manually install python-escpos and pyusb libs from source. 

### ESC POS Commands

Also I've added ESC POS Commands FAQ Files
